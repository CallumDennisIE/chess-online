## Design
### Colour Scheme
The project uses a very simple colour scheme to match the pieces on a chessboard. The text is black on a white background, to create a strong contrast, the chess pieces are also either fully black or white with a black outline, making it very clear which piece is for a specific player.

The chessboard is alternating white and grey squares, to allow both white and black pieces to contrast well off of the background. The only other colour is the red for highlighting a square to be captured, this is a strong colour to make it clear when a piece is able to be captured, as this is part of the win condition for the game.

### Typography
The fonts used in this project are taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

- The font [Acme](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Acme?query=acme) was used for the headings.
- [Exo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Exo?query=exo) was used for the remaining text on the project.
- If the fonts from Google Fonts could not be displayed, then 'Sans-serif' was used as a backup font.
