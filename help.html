            <h2>How to Play:</h2>

            <h3>The Basics</h3>
            <p>Chess Online is a variant of the classic game chess. In this game, 2 players use different pieces to move
                around the chessboard and try to capture all of their opponents pieces.</p>
            <p>Each piece has a different set of moves and a different points cost if they are captured. The player the
                captures all of their opoents peices (and gets all 52 points) wins!</p>

            <h3>Where can my Piece Move to?</h3>
            <p>To move see the availble moves for a specific piece, click on it. The pieces that can be moved too are
                highlighted with a 'X'.</p>
            <p>Please note, that the selected piece much match the same colour, as the current players turn (shown
                underneath the chessboard), otherwise the movable squares will not be highlighted.</p>
            <p>If a piece cannot move, then no highlighted squares will be shown.</p>
            <p>To clear the squares marked with an 'X', click anywhere on the chessboard except for a square makred with
                an
                'X'.</p>
            <p>If the square is marked with an 'X' and the square is red, then that square is occupied with an opposing
                piece and can be captured!</p>

            <h3>How to Move a Piece</h3>
            <p>To move a piece to a highlighted square, click on the highlighted square.</p>
            <p>If your piece is moving to a square that contains an opposing piece, then you will capture that piece and
                gain a number of points, depending on the pieces value.</p>
